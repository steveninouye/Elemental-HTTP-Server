    <h3>Atomic number 1</h3>
    <p>Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen
        is the lightest element on the periodic table. its monatomic form (h) is the most abundant chemical substance in
        the universe, constituting roughly 75 percent of all baryonic mass. non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen
        in its plasma state. the most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1h), has a single
        proton and zero neutrons.</p>
